Some notes about this SS evaluation. In the original EB repository, there is a fasta file with archiveII sequences used for evaluating packages. There is no dataframe available that I could find with corresponding structures used. So, I downloaded the archiveII dataset from the Matthews Lab [here](https://rna.urmc.rochester.edu/pub/archiveII.tar.gz). Then I filtered through the fasta file to get a folder of .ct files for each sequence in the archiveII fasta file from EternaBench. Lastly, I used the function ct_to_bp_list in the arnie/utils.py to get a bplist for each sequence. Then from there used arnie to convert bp_list to dot bracket notation. That was how the file archiveII_dataset_fixed.csv was created. However, due to the differences in exact sequences included in archiveII curated datsets, as well as different ways of representing secondary structure in dbn, I recommend going over and generating a new dataset file if using these archiveII sequences for evaluating secondary structure predictions.
