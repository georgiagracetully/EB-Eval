## CM Evaluation 

Notebooks for generating predictions with RibonanzaNet-SS on RNA sequences. These predicted base pairing matrices are then converted to probability of unpaired vectors. These "punp" vectors are then treated as predicted chemical reactivity profiles. The output of these notebooks are .json files in the format used for scoring in the EternaBench repository.
